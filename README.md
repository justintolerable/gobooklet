A booklet intended for children aged 9-13.  I have aimed for simplicity, with the assumption that they have a teacher who can field questions or develop their understanding further.

To be printed on A4 / Letter paper and folded into an A5 booklet.

TO PRINT AS A BOOKLET:

- If your printer is capable of double sided printing, download the regular version of the PDF.  Open in Adobe Reader or Acrobat and choose 'Booklet' in the print menu.
- If your printer is not capable, download the Booklet Friendly version of the PDF.  Print a single page, then flip and reinsert into the printer.  Print the next page.  Then move on to the next sheet and repeat the process until complete.
